                        This is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven
                        development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming
                        events.
                        The serverless provider chosen for this purpose is Amazon Web Services.

                        The client-side of the myFlix app includes several interface views (built using the React
                        library) that will handle data through the (previously defined) REST API endpoints.

                    <h2>React Native Mobile Chat App</h2>
                    <p>
                        The prevalence of mobile devices in daily tasks has led to the demand for efficient
                        communication apps.
                        This project aims to address this demand by building a native chat app using React Native, Expo,
                        and Google Firestore Database.
                        The app serves as a showcase of JavaScript mobile development skills and offers a platform for
                        users to engage in seamless conversations, share images, and exchange location data.
